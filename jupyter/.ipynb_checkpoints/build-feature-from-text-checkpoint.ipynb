The second line of code below performs this task.\n",

This causes words such as “argue”, \"argued\", \"arguing\", \"argues\" to be reduced to their common stem “argu”. There are many ways to perform Stemming, the popular one being the “Porter Stemmer” method by Martin Porter. The fourth to sixth lines of code below perform this task.\n",

In simple terms, TF-IDF attempts to highlight important words which appear frequently in a document but not across documents. The terms are briefly explained below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Term Frequency (TF): This summarizes the normalized Term Frequency within a document.\n",

    "1. Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): This reduces the weight of terms that appear a lot across documents.\n",

The second line initializes the TfidfVectorizer object, called 'tfidf', while the third line fits and transforms the variable 'processedtext' from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important arguments we have used in initiating the TfidfVectorizer object are the 'max_features' and the 'ngram_range'. While the 'max_features' argument specifies the maximum number of features to be created, the argument 'ngram_range=(1,1)' specifies that unigrams will be considered for feature creation.\n",
