    "Hash tags are author assigned labels the data is labeling itself. Albiet flimsy, potentially esoteric or sureal or irrelivant. Nevertheless there is a reason the author wrote the hash tag. So lets investigate What is the function of the hash tag, and can we derive a value system for the author by measuring self labeling, and liked tweets that also are hash labled? Essentially the label is for social signaling."
