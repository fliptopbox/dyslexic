    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversational _NLP_, or natural language processing, is playing a big part in text analytics through chatbots. A chatbot is an artificial intelligence based tool built to converse with humans in their native language. These chatbots have become popular across industries, and are considered one of the most useful applications of natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, you will learn to build your first chatbot using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Baseline Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be using the `nltk` library in this guide. NLTK stands for _Natural Language Toolkit_ and is a leading python library to work with text data. The first line of code below imports the library, while the second line uses the `nltk.chat` module to import the required utilities.\n"
